# MFP - Molecular Functional Portrait

The Molecular Functional (MF) Portrait is a planetary schematic representation of integrated molecular and functional characteristics of a tumor and its microenvironment based on whole exome (WES) and RNAseq analysis. The MF Portrait depicts the prevalence of malignant and tumor microenvironment (TME) cell populations, and the activity of tumor promoting and suppressing processes. The portrait includes qualitative and quantitative descriptions of modules built based on the expression of BostonGene curated 29 gene expression signatures (reference manuscript and table), with the size of each module corresponding to the intensity of the normalized single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) score, and the colors denoting pro- (red) or anti-cancer activity (blue). In the MF Portrait, potentially targetable genomic alterations and TME processes such as cell proliferation, EMT, angiogenesis, and anti-tumor immunity are listed. The relevant TME subtypes (reference our paper) for each tumor, identified based on BostonGene classification platform, is are integrated into the MF Tumor Portrait to aid in the rational design of therapeutic strategies.

## TME subtypes include:

* Immune-enriched, fibrotic (IE/F)
* Immune-enriched (IE)
* Fibrotic (F)
* Depleted (D)
